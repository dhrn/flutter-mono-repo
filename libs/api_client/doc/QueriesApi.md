# **findNodes**
> NodePaging findNodes(term, rootNodeId, skipCount, maxItems, nodeType, include, orderBy, fields)

Find nodes

**Note:** this endpoint is available in Alfresco 5.2 and newer versions.  Gets a list of nodes that match the given search criteria.  The search term is used to look for nodes that match against name, title, description, full text content or tags.  The search term: - must contain a minimum of 3 alphanumeric characters - allows \"quoted term\" - can optionally use '*' for wildcard matching  By default, file and folder types will be searched unless a specific type is provided as a query parameter.  By default, the search will be across the repository unless a specific root node id is provided to start the search from.  You can sort the result list using the **orderBy** parameter. You can specify one or more of the following fields in the **orderBy** parameter: * name * modifiedAt * createdAt 

### Example 
```dart
import 'package:api_client/api.dart';
// TODO Configure HTTP basic authorization: basicAuth
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<HttpBasicAuth>('basicAuth').username = 'YOUR_USERNAME'
//defaultApiClient.getAuthentication<HttpBasicAuth>('basicAuth').password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD';

var api_instance = new QueriesApi();
var term = term_example; // String | The term to search for.
var rootNodeId = rootNodeId_example; // String | The id of the node to start the search from.  Supports the aliases -my-, -root- and -shared-. 
var skipCount = 56; // int | The number of entities that exist in the collection before those included in this list. If not supplied then the default value is 0. 
var maxItems = 56; // int | The maximum number of items to return in the list. If not supplied then the default value is 100. 
var nodeType = nodeType_example; // String | Restrict the returned results to only those of the given node type and its sub-types 
var include = []; // BuiltList<String> | Returns additional information about the node. The following optional fields can be requested: * allowableOperations * aspectNames * isLink * isFavorite * isLocked * path * properties 
var orderBy = []; // BuiltList<String> | A string to control the order of the entities returned in a list. You can use the **orderBy** parameter to sort the list by one or more fields.  Each field has a default sort order, which is normally ascending order. Read the API method implementation notes above to check if any fields used in this method have a descending default search order.  To sort the entities in a specific order, you can use the **ASC** and **DESC** keywords for any field. 
var fields = []; // BuiltList<String> | A list of field names.  You can use this parameter to restrict the fields returned within a response if, for example, you want to save on overall bandwidth.  The list applies to a returned individual entity or entries within a collection.  If the API method also supports the **include** parameter, then the fields specified in the **include** parameter are returned in addition to those specified in the **fields** parameter. 

try { 
    var result = api_instance.findNodes(term, rootNodeId, skipCount, maxItems, nodeType, include, orderBy, fields);
    print(result);
} catch (e) {
    print('Exception when calling QueriesApi->findNodes: $e\n');
}
